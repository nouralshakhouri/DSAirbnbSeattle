# Data Science - Which Factors Affect Airbnb Seattle Pricing ?
# DSAirbnbSeattle

## Project Motivation : 
In this report we will study and analyze Airbnb Seattle Dataset in order to answer the following questions (Udacity Data Science Nano Degree requimrent)?
1. Whom are the top 15 hosts in Seattle?
2. Which are the top 15 booked neighbourhoods ?
3. What are the top factors affecting the price?
4. What is the average of the accommodations based on the previous factors?

## Methodology :
We use CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) which is an industry-proven methodology for data mining which was proposed by IBM. The following are the steps following to draw the conclusions:
* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Data Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment


## Requirements to run the project:
Program and Libraries
This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

## Datasets:

## Founding and Results:
We found out that the price mainly affected the following factors using the correlation heatmap
1. Number of people the listing can accommodates
2. Number of bedrooms
3. Number of beds
We noticed that the price increase is proportional to the number of people it accommodates and/or number of bedrooms and beds.

## Ackoweldgement:
I would like to thank Udacity for the support, kaggle for providing the dataset, github for hosting the project, and medium for publishing the project.
